### Writing a "Hello World" Program in Rust

When starting with Rust, the first step often involves writing a simple "Hello World" program. This program is written in a file named `main.rs`. The file contains a basic function that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Here's what the code looks like:

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Understanding Cargo

After writing your first Rust program, you might want to explore a tool called **Cargo**. Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager. It helps you manage your Rust projects, dependencies, and build processes.

To create a new project with Cargo, you use the command:

```bash
cargo new hello_world
```

This command creates a new directory named `hello_world` with all the files and folders needed to start a Rust project.

### Exploring the Cargo Project Structure

When you create a project using Cargo, you'll notice a few key components:

1. **Cargo.toml:** This file is located at the root of your project. It's a configuration file that defines the project name, version, dependencies, and other metadata. Think of it as the project's manifest file.

   Here's a simple example of what `Cargo.toml` might look like:

   ```toml
   [package]
   name = "hello_world"
   version = "0.1.0"
   edition = "2021"

   [dependencies]
   ```

   - `[package]`: Defines the basic information about your project.
   - `[dependencies]`: Lists any external libraries your project needs.

2. **src Directory:** Inside the `src` folder, you'll find another `main.rs` file. This is where the actual code for your project lives. Rust projects typically have their main code in the `src` directory.

3. **target Folder:** This folder is generated when you build or run your project using Cargo. It contains compiled versions of your program and other artifacts. You don't usually need to interact with this folder directly, but it's essential for running your code.

### Summary

In summary, starting with Rust involves writing a basic "Hello World" program and using Cargo to manage your projects. Cargo helps organize your code with a structured directory, including important files like `Cargo.toml` for configuration, `src` for your code, and `target` for compiled outputs. These tools make it easier to build, manage, and share your Rust projects.
